# Gatsby + Netlify CMS Blog

**This project is no longer under development due to the deprecation of Netlify CMS**

This repo contains a blog built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org).

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

It was built by modifying this [starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) for my needs.
