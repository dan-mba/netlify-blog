### Why I started a blog

This blog started as a project for me to learn how to use 
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org).
Gatsby is a React based static site generator.
I chose Gatsby because of my knowledge of React and the ease of integration with a CMS.
Netlify CMS is the content management system I chose,
because it stores data in markdown files & does not require a database.

#### What I will cover

I am primarily developing projects in JavaScript, so I will focus on that.
That will include the frameworks & libraries I use, primarily React & Vue,
along with my build tools.

I am also trying to learn other server side programming languages, 
so I may occasionally write about them (Python, Java, etc).
